    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pelmeni are traditional Russian dumplings consisting of a thin 
        dough filled with a mixture of minced meat, which can include 
        pork, beef, lamb, or chicken. They are typically boiled until 
        tender and served with a dollop of sour cream, butter, or vinegar, 
        often garnished with fresh herbs like dill.</p>
